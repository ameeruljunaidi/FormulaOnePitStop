# Summary

+ Choking under pressure "Three studies show that increased attention to one's own
  process of performance resulted in performance decrements"
  [@baumeister1984choking]
+ Coaches implement significantly more offensive substitutions if their teams are
  behind expectations [@bartling2015expectations] - this focuses on "reference
  point"

# Quotes & Data

+ Divergences of economic decision making from neo-classical theories
+ “Studying sport is a great idea, because people make many decisions that matter
  enormously to them under standard conditions. It is actually one of the best
  places to do this” [@kahneman2008personal]
+ The whole setup is artificial. It is not a decision that really affects them and
  to which they are used [@hart2005interview]
+ If stones falling from towers and apples from trees are useful for physics, then
  data from sports competitions may be useful for economics [@palacios2016beautiful]

# Questions

+ Evidence of loss aversion in professional golf [@pope2011tiger] - this might be
  interesting, is there loss aversion in Formula 1 as well?
+ Pulling starters decisions are approximately Bayesian optimal
  [@finigan2020pulling]
    + Win probability is unaffected by pulling the starter
    + Results are consistent with win maximization by managers
    + Fail to find biases caused by recent events or other game factors

# Random

+ Female chess players underperform their male counterparts in fast chess games
  [@dilmaghani2020gender] - not related to this paper but reminds me of Queen's
  Gambit, big fan
