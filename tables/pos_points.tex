\caption{Shows points awarded to drivers for every Grand Prix based on their position at the end of the race. Since there are 20 drivers on the grid, half of the drivers on the grid will get no points and drivers that not in the points will do whatever they can to get in the points, including taking extra pit stops to get fresher tires to catch up with the drivers right ahead of them.}
