# Summary

- They're essentially using a model to predict when is the "optimal" time to pull
  the goalie
- Even if they push the probability of it working significantly, coaches are still
  pulling their goalies too early
- How it relates to investment
    * Pulling the goalie increases the volatility of number of goals scored, and is
      a negative expectation in terms of scores
    * It's equivalent to an investors' high-risk, desperation move, but it's also an
      insurance move (it reduces the risk of losing a game)
    * Investors focus on the risk of an investment, not the risk added to their
      overall portfolio
    * In other words, they focus more on the volatility of their portfolio rather
      than the probability of bad returns over the long run

# Quotes and Data

- Pulling the goalie has a negative expected value move in terms of goals (1.97%
  < 4.30%) - pulling goalie 4x opponent's chance of scoring, but not even 2x its own
  chance to score
- At 6:10 remaining, you should pull goalie, but at 6:20, you should not pull the
  goalie
- Optimal goalie pulling gains an average of 0.05 more points per game - 4.18 points
  in an 82-game season, over a team that never pulls the goalie
- Right now coaches are pulling at the 6-min mark, they should be pulling at the
  13-mark, something that you don't see happening right now
- Pulling the goalie is effectively like an option holder being able to increase
  volatility on their own (at the cost of lowering the expected return)
- Coaches are not rewarded for winning, they're rewarded for being perceived as good
  coaches
- Winning ugly is undervalued versus losing elegantly; and losing ugly can be career
  suicide
- The way you measure risk matters in making the optimal decision

# Random

- They defined the score differential, we should do the same with our method of
  calculating positions during the race
