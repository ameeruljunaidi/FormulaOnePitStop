# Main Sources

- Main source is this paper [@BARELI2020101598]
    * Has a list of all past papers that has been written on that does sports and
      economics why does this work
    * Notes are all in [Sports Economics](bar-eli_2020.md)
- Another good source is the hockey thing [@asness2018pulling]
    * Notes are in [Pulling Goalie](asness_2018.md)

# Structure of Paper

- Start with a story, need to highlight importance of pit stops
    * I think the story on Russel would be good, very recent, fresh on everyone's
      mind, pretty good story too
- Explain the basics of Formula 1
    * How does the point system works
    * What does a pit stop have anything to do with winning a race
        + Talk about tire management
        + Other variables: track temperatures, weather, etc.
- Explain our thesis, what do we think is happening 

# General Questions

- For drivers at the back of the grid, would it be then best to stay out if all the
  other drivers are going in to make a pit stop
- Wouldn't we also want to get rid of drivers that retired? Because they would
  obviously pit a lot less than drivers who finished the race

# Required data

- I want to show an example of how tyre management can change the lap time. Example:
  At lap 13h Hamilton pitted and changed from medium to hard tyre and at lap 28,
  lewis pitted again and changed to mid tyre. 
    * Through lap 0-13 Medium 
    * Through 13-28 hard tyre 
    * Through 29-end medium tyre 

It would be great if we can make bar chart that shows visually shows the
difference of medium and hard tyres (y= lap time ,x=number of lap ) So far the
above info shows when and what tyres Hamilton changed in the race. 

# To Do List

- [x] Remove drivers that didn't finish the race
- [x] See if drivers that take more pit stops are actually in the back of the grid
- [ ] Figure out a way to get delta to defender (driver right ahead)
- [x] Get Kenshin's average number of pit stops between 2010-2020
